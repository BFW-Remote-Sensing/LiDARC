# LiDARC

**LiDARC** is a project developed in the context of remote sensing and LiDAR data processing.  
The goal of the project is to provide a clear, well-structured foundation for working with LiDAR-based data, including a defined domain model, system architecture, and user-facing documentation.

This repository contains both the source code and the accompanying project documentation.
